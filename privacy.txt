Privacy Policy for Worksheet Wizard

Last Updated: Jan 6th 2024

1. Introduction

Welcome to Worksheet Wizard. This privacy policy explains how we handle the data processed by our GPT-4 powered action, which converts markdown worksheets into PDFs.

2. Data Collection and Use

We collect and process data only as necessary to perform the conversion service. This includes the content of the markdown worksheets submitted by users.

3. Data Processing

The action uses GPT-4 technology to interpret the markdown content and convert it into a PDF format. No additional personal data is collected or used during this process.

4. Data Storage and Security

The PDF files generated are not stored permanently. They are automatically deleted from our system after 5 minutes. We employ robust security measures to protect data during its short lifespan on our servers.

5. User Consent

By using our service, users consent to the data practices described in this policy. Users are responsible for any personal data or sensitive information included in the markdown worksheets they submit.

6. Data Access and Portability

Since the PDF files are automatically deleted after 5 minutes, there is no provision for user access or data portability for the generated files.

7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically.
